"Very often the values are for one or more areas of interest such as goals or"
" game pieces and multiple instances are returned. In the example below, "
"several x, y, width, height, and areas are returned by the image processor "
"and the robot program can sort out which of the returned values are "
"interesting through further processing."
msgstr ""
"通常，这些值是针对一个或多个感兴趣区域（例如目标或游戏片段）的，并且会返回多个实例。在下面的示例中，图像处理器返回了多个x，y，宽度，高度和区域，并且机器人程序可以通过进一步的处理来找出返回的值中哪些是有趣的。"

"Both of the following examples are extremely simplified programs that just "
"illustrate the use of NetworkTables. All the code is in the robotInit() "
"method so it's only run when the program starts up. In your programs, you "
"would more likely get the values in code that is evaluating which direction "
"to aim the robot in a command or a control loop during the autonomous or "
"teleop periods."
msgstr ""
"下面的两个示例都是高度简化的程序，仅说明了网络表的用法。所有代码都在robotInit()方法中，因此仅在程序启动时运行。在您的程序中，这些值的获取大多会在比赛的自动阶段或手动阶段，使机器人瞄向一个方向的指令或控制循环中进行。"

"In this case the program is only looking at the array of areas, but in a "
"real example all the values would more likely be used. Using the Riolog in "
"VS Code or the Driver Station log you can see the values as they are "
"retrieved. This program is using a sample static image so they areas don't "
"change, but you can imagine with a camera on your robot, the values would be"
" changing constantly."
msgstr ""
"在这种情况下，程序仅查看关于areas数组，但在实际示例中，更可能所有值都会被使用。使用VS Code中的Riolog或Driver "
"Station日志，您可以看到被检索的值。该程序使用的是示例静态图像，因此区域数值不会改变。但是您可以想象在机器人上安装摄像头后，值会不断变化。"
