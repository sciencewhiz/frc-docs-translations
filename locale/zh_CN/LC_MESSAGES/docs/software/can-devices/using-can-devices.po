"CAN connections are daisy-chained from device to device, which often results"
" in much shorter wire runs than having to wire each device to the RIO "
"itself."
msgstr "CAN连接以菊链的形式连接设备，这种方式与将每个设备都连接到RIO上的接线时间短得多。"

"CAN is bi-directional, so CAN motor controllers can send data back to the "
"RIO, again facilitating a more expansive feature-set than can be offered by "
"PWM Controllers."
msgstr "CAN连接是双向的，所以CAN电机可以把数据传回RIO，因此CAN电机比PWM电机可以拥有更多的功能。"

"CAN devices generally have their own WPILib classes.  The following sections"
" will describe the use of several of these classes."
