"The ``DifferentialDriveKinematics`` class is a useful tool that converts "
"between a ``ChassisSpeeds`` object and a ``DifferentialDriveWheelSpeeds`` "
"object, which contains velocities for the left and right sides of a "
"differential drive robot."
msgstr ""
"``DifferentialDriveKinematics``类是一个有用的工具，它可以在``ChassisSpeeds``对象和``DifferentialDriveWheelSpeeds``对象之间进行转换，其中包含差动驱动机器人左右两侧的速度。"

"The ``DifferentialDriveKinematics`` object accepts one constructor argument,"
" which is the track width of the robot. This represents the distance between"
" the two sets of wheels on a differential drive."
msgstr ""
"“DifferentialDriveKinematics”对象接受一个构造函数参数，即机器人的轨道宽度。这代表了差速器上两组轮子之间的距离。"
