"Additionally, the roboRIO supports communications with peripheral devices "
"over the CAN bus.  However, as the FRC CAN protocol is quite idiosyncratic, "
"relatively few peripheral sensors support it (though it is heavily used for "
"motor controllers). One of the advantages of using the CAN bus protocol is "
"that devices can be daisy-chained, as shown below. If power is removed from "
"any device in the chain, data signals will still be able to reach all "
"devices in the chain."
msgstr ""
"此外，roboRIO支持通过CAN总线与外围设备进行通信。但是，由于FRC "
"CAN协议非常特殊，因此很少有外围传感器支持该协议（尽管它广泛用于电机控制器）。使用CAN总线协议的优点之一是可以采用菊花链方式连接设备，如下所示。如果断开链中任何设备的电源，数据信号仍将能够到达链中的所有设备。"
