"It is recommended that the wiring starts at the roboRIO and ends at the PDP "
"because the CAN network is required to be terminated by 120 :math:`\\Omega` "
"resistors and these are built into these two devices.  The PDP ships with "
"the CAN bus terminating resistor jumper in the \"ON\" position. It is "
"recommended to leave the jumper in this position and place any additional "
"CAN nodes between the roboRIO and the PDP (leaving the PDP as the end of the"
" bus). If you wish to place the PDP in the middle of the bus (utilizing both"
" pairs of PDP CAN terminals) move the jumper to the \"OFF\" position and "
"place your own 120 :math:`\\Omega` terminating resistor at the end of your "
"CAN bus chain."

"布线从roboRIO处开始，在PDP处结束是被建议的，因为CAN网络需要用120:math:`\\Omega`电阻终止，而这两个器件都内置了这些电阻。PDP随附的CAN总线终端电阻的跳线处于“"
" "
"ON”位置。建议将跳线保持在此位置，并将任何额外的CAN节点放置在roboRIO和PDP之间（保证PDP位于总线末端）。如果您希望将PDP放置在总线中间（使用两对PDP"
" CAN端子），将跳线移至“ OFF”位置，并将自己的120 :math:`\\Omega` 终端电阻放置在CAN总线链的末端。 "
